A test post...
for each post you can declare sone value in the upper side like this:
```
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome !"
date:   2022-01-01 23:05:45 +0100
categories: jekyll 
---
```
they are needed to have the post correctly shown, the are probably configured in the theme, in this case ([minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima))
